Day 3: 

</h1>
<p>
	 Day 3 is alright. I made links to my other pages. Everything is going well so far, no problems here. I've never really thought about making a website, but now the idea doesn't seem so bad.
</p> 
<h1>
	Day 4:
	</h1>
<p>
	We uploaded our code for our website on to github. We created a folder, and used terminal so that our wbesite would appear on github. 

	Note: To add things to my online version 
	<ul>
		<li> Open terminal and nagviagte to folder by typing cd (space)
		./documents/c27ha1.github.io</li>

		<li> To see if i added anything type "git status", and it will show changes I haven't saved to the online version</li>

		<li> To add what I typed <b> git add .</b></li>

		<li> The commit changes and this means adding a note that markswhat i did so say <b> git commit -m "whatever i did"</b></li>


		<li>  to finsish it off and put my changes online type git push</li>

	</ul>
	<h1>
		Day 5:
	</h1>
	<p>
		I got work done. Almost finished the front page of my website. It's looking goo so far. I want add a scroll feature, which I will do soon. So far everything is alright. 
</p>
	<h1> 
		Day 6:
	</h1>
		<p> 
		I linked my animation to my porjects page. I am in the middle of cleaning up the front page of my website. When I push to github the proportions of my website are a bit off. Somethings are shifted slighty to the right or left. I will probably make a lab, or figure out how to do it myself. 
	</p>
	<h1> 
		Day 7:
	</h1>
		<p> 
		I made a jumpscare of an image of plabyboi carti. One of his adlibs plays when you click on the screen. An image of carti also appears. It's alright. 
	</p>

	<h1>
		Day 8:
	</h1>
	<p>
		I fixed my jumpscare or rather updated it. My jumpscare was "alright" in comparison to others. I could tell they put much more effort than me so I decided to step it up. I added and gift and some background music.
	</p>
	<h1>
		Day 9:
	</h1>
	<p> 
		Learned about what a function was. In our teachers words its a recipe (or like a recipe) that automates things. It allows for things to be done over and over again without you having to type new code everytime. All thr functions already exist, it's just how we use them which is different. For example all the words in the english language already exist but its ho we use them to make sentences that are different.
