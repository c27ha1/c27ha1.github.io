    <h1>Day 3:</h1>
    <p>
        Day 3 is alright. I made links to my other pages. Everything is going well so far, no problems here. I've never really thought about making a website, but now the idea doesn't seem so bad.
    </p>
    <h1>Day 4:</h1>
    <p>
        We uploaded our code for our website on to github. We created a folder, and used terminal so that our website would appear on github.
    </p>
    <p>Note: To add things to my online version:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Open terminal and navigate to folder by typing cd (space) ./documents/c27ha1.github.io</li>
        <li>To see if I added anything type "git status", and it will show changes I haven't saved to the online version</li>
        <li>To add what I typed <b> git add .</b></li>
        <li>The commit changes and this means adding a note that marks what I did so say <b> git commit -m "whatever I did"</b></li>
        <li>To finish it off and put my changes online type git push</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Day 5:</h1>
    <p>
        I got work done. Almost finished the front page of my website. It's looking good so far. I want to add a scroll feature, which I will do soon. So far everything is alright.
    </p>
    <h1>Day 6:</h1>
    <p>
        I linked my animation to my projects page. I am in the middle of cleaning up the front page of my website. When I push to github the proportions of my website are a bit off. Some things are shifted slightly to the right or left. I will probably make a lab, or figure out how to do it myself.
    </p>
    <h1>Day 7:</h1>
    <p>
        I made a jumpscare of an image of playboi carti. One of his adlibs plays when you click on the screen. An image of carti also appears. It's alright.
    </p>
    <h1>Day 8:</h1>
    <p>
        I fixed my jumpscare or rather updated it. My jumpscare was "alright" in comparison to others. I could tell they put much more effort than me so I decided to step it up. I added and gif and some background music.
    </p>
    <h1>Day 9:</h1>
    <p>
        Learned about what a function was. In our teacher's words, it's a recipe (or like a recipe) that automates things. It allows for things to be done over and over again without you having to type new code every time. All the functions already exist, it's just how we use them which is different. For example, all the words in the English language already exist but it's how we use them to make sentences that are different.
    </p>
    <h1>Day:10</h1>
    <p>
        I made my gratitude card for my friend group. The name of the group chat is called Pizzabagels which is why the project is called Pizzabagels. I made a slideshow of very funny photos. I enjoyed it very much.
    </p>
    <h1>Day:11</h1>
    <p>
        After hard work, my tier list... kinda works. Yes, I have to re-click pink tape after every time you move an album, otherwise, the album disappears. I'll probably fix it in the future, but as of right now I'm content with it. I had to use the clicking feature and removing event listeners. It's alright.
    </p>
    <h1>Day:12</h1>
    <p>
        We used math today in HTML to generate random items from our array that we made. Every time you click and go to the console log, a different item from the list will appear. Sometimes it repeats, but for the most part, it's random.
    </p>
    <h1>Day:13</h1>
    <p>
        We made a moving car using arrow keys. We had to use the keypress function, for the console to log which key we were pressing, and then perform the function. The car can move back and forth, and up and down.
        
    </p>

    <h1>Day:14</h1>
    <p> 
    	I was able to push the website that was made with reveal.js to my actual website. The website is a slide show, so the transitions are much better. I also made a love calculator. Whenever you input two names, it puts out a random number, saying it's the compatibility of your love. If you put the name Hasin, no matter what you put as the partner's name, compatibility will be 100 percent. 
    </p>

    <h1>Day:15</h1>
    <p> 
        Learned about color today. We use rbh and use different values of red green and blue to make different colors. At first everytime you cicked a certain button it would change color, but now everytime you move youf mouse the color of the background changes.       
    </p>

    <h1>Day:16</h1>
    <p> 
        Stupid questions: Why are colors so important? (People can be tell the difference between some colors). 
        Color is most common in websites?
        Are there certain colors people use to catch attention or make people some certain type of way?
        Why is purple and all its shades the best colors?
