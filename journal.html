Day 3: 

</h1>
<p>
	 Day 3 is alright. I made links to my other pages. Everything is going well so far, no problems here. I've never really thought about making a website, but now the idea doesn't seem so bad.
</p> 
<h1>
	Day 4:
	</h1>
<p>
	We uploaded our code for our website on to github. We created a folder, and used terminal so that our wbesite would appear on github. 

	Note: To add things to my online version 
	<ul>
		<li> Open terminal and nagviagte to folder by typing cd (space)
		./documents/c27ha1.github.io</li>

		<li> To see if i added anything type "git status", and it will show changes I haven't saved to the online version</li>

		<li> To add what I typed <b> git add .</b></li>

		<li> The commit changes and this means adding a note that markswhat i did so say <b> git commit -m "whatever i did"</b></li>


		<li>  to finsish it off and put my changes online type git push</li>

	</ul>
